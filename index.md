M²aia (MSI applications for interactive analysis in MITK) is a software tool enabling interactive signal processing and visualisation of mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) datasets. M²aia extends the open source Medical Imaging and Interaction Toolkit (MITK) [1] and provides powerful methods that the MSI community can adopt, exploit and improve further. In it's current state, it is designet to enable multi-modal 2D registration and 3D MSI reconstruction.

In addition, M²aia provides features for 

* Read/write access to the open standard imzML
* Image interaction and visualization
* Signal processing: Normalization, baseline correction, smoothing and peak picking
* Image segmentation
* Multi-modal 3D reconstruction of MSI images 
* Image registration of 2D multi-modal images
