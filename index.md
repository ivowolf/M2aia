## M²aia

M²aia (MSI applications for interactive analysis in MITK) is a software tool enabling interactive signal processing and visualisation of mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) datasets. M²aia extends the open source Medical Imaging and Interaction Toolkit (MITK) [1] and provides powerful methods that the MSI community can adopt, exploit and improve further. In it's current state, it is designet to enable multi-modal 2D registration and 3D MSI reconstruction.

In addition, M²aia provides features for image segmentation, dimensionality reduction, elastix-based image registration [2], read/write access to the open standard imzML, spectral/signal processing (smoothing, basline correction, normalization)
